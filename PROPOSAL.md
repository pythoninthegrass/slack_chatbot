# Proposal

## Why it does
* Prevent routine tickets from being generated by empowering users to help themselves

## What it does
* Interprets keywords/phrases and serves URLs for KB articles in public channel(s) (e.g., `#it`)
    * Ignores DMs

## How it does
* Python
* Slack API
* Keyword phrase mapping (options)
    * Hard-coded list of KB articles
    * Dynamic generation of links
        * Confluence/Simpplr API
* Slackbot API (more work)
    * Data source (k8s config map/config file)

## Security
* Uses standard library and official Slack Python SDK
* Minimal Slack permissions
    * Read/post messages
    * Assign to specific channels
* No message content is stored
* Ensure content (keywords, KB articles) is validated?

## Infrastructure
* Docker dev locally
* k8s
    * dev/prod
    * ci/cd
        * Dajoku
        * Github (Actions)
        * CircleCI
* Key-value store
    * external
    * sqlite
    * json
    * redis

## Maintenance / Ownership
* IT owns code
* Deployment
    * Helm chart
    * Dajoku
        * All resources live in repo
    * Other (Github Actions)

## Prior to release
* IT
    * Features, brainstorming
* Security
    * Signoff
* Infra
    * Best practices
* Technical Ops (TOPs)
    * Pros/cons of Dajoku apps (if used)
